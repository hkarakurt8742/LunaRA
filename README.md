# LunaRA
LunaRa is an RShiny App to Annotate Variants and Network Based Analysis of Interactions, Pharmacogenomic and Disease Associations

LunaRa takes variants as VCF (Variant Call Format) and annotates the variants using MyVariant.Info database.
It also creates a protein-protein interation network (PPIN)  using the genes with variants and their first-neighbour and applies enrichment analysis to the nodes using KEGG and GeneOntology Biological Process databases.
LunaRa also finds pharmacogenomic interactions and disease annotations using public databases.
